Experimental comparators for collections to be generic over.

Documentation is available at https://contain-rs.github.io/compare/compare.

To use `compare` with Cargo, add this to `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
compare = "0.1"
```

and this to the crate root:

```rust
extern crate compare;
```
